    // Location, Line and Column (in Location elements) are not always comparable (eg, CCK refers to source line #s in typescript)
    // Uri is not always comparable (eg, CCK refers to source file paths in typescript)
    // JavaMethod and JavaStackTraceElement contents are specific to the platform. CCK does not include these as it generates Uri references to source rather than Method references
    // Exception: Exceptions are not comparable
    // Duration: time values are not comparable
    // UseForSnippets: Reqnroll defaults to false always regardless of what is in the CCK
    // Start: Start refers to a column position in source code, which may not be comparable across platforms.
    // FileName: CCK does not provide the file name of attachments but Reqnroll does
    // ProtocolVersion, Implementation, Runtime, Cpu, Os, Ci: These properties of the Meta message are not comparable across platforms.

    // Line, Column, Seconds and Nanos are skipped, rather than their container types (Location and TimeStamp & Duration, respectively),
