Reqnroll.Tools.MsBuild.Generation (pronounced as [reknroʊl]) enables code-behind file generation during build time for Reqnroll projects.

This package provides MSBuild tasks and targets that automatically generate test code from Gherkin feature files during the build process, eliminating the need for manual code generation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Targeting Support**: Works with both .NET Framework and .NET Core projects
- **Custom Build Configuration**: Configurable build options and target frameworks
- **IDE Integration**: Seamless integration with Visual Studio and other IDEs

## Usage
