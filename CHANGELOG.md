# [vNext]

## Improvements:

* Add `RuleInfo` to `ScenarioContext` to provide information about the current rule (#454)
* Ensure that the runtime plugins are loaded in an alphabetic order based on file name on Unix-based platforms. (#519)
* Reqnroll: Added `VerifyCaseInsensitive` flag to `InstanceCreationOptions` that allows for case-insensitive member verification when object instances are created from tables (#577)
* Improvement: MsTest simple scenarios (not Scenario Outlines) uses the Scenario Name as the friendly name for the test (#588)
* Improvement: Introducing the ability to specify env var "REQNROLL_DRY_RUN=true" to skip invocation of step handlers at runtime (#614)
* Improvement: MsTest Scenario Outlines use the Scenario Name as the friendly name for the test
* Refactored UnitTestFeatureGenerator to provide an output parameter that contains warnings (#624)
* Improvement: Added a CreateDirectory() function to the Reqnroll.Utils/IFileSystem (#623)
* Improvement: Ambiguous binding situations now return the list of Binding Matches that caused the AmbiguousMatchException (#622)
* Refactored functions that provide Environment Information (eg, current OS Version) into a common service (#620)
* Upgrade to Gherkin v32 from v30 (see [Gherkin changelog](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)) (#489)
* Refactoring of the ExecutionEvents and Event Publishing. Events carry more context information; publication is now async. (#621)
* Provide AsyncEventHandler in RuntimePluginTestExecutionLifecycleEvents (#634)
* Improved test execution time by decoupling the telemetry sending from the execution. (#629)
* Improved test feature context and feature hook handling for non-parallel or class-parallel scenarios where the scenarios of the feature are not executed in sequence. (#638)
* Renamed Regex for all step definition attributes to Expression, as it has a cucumber expression or a regular expression (regex) that matches the step text. (Breaking change) (#639)
* Introduced a new BuildMetadata class to encapsulate CI metadata properties such as ProductName, BuildUrl, BuildNumber, Remote, Revision, Branch, and Tag. These will be used to populate data in Cucumber Messages. (#658)

## Bug fixes:

* Fix: Exception in an `AfterFeature` hook causes the next first test failure in the next feature (#597)
* Fix: Disposed ObjectContainer can be accessed through RegisterInstanceAs/RegisterFactoryAs/RegisterTypeAs
* Fix: Namespace clash in generated files if no RootNamespace is defined in the project file (#633)

* Fix: Inconsistent hook execution (duble execution, before/after hook skipped, infrastructure errors) when before or after hooks fail (#526)
* Fix: Namespace collisions in generated code when Reqnroll project namespace contains "System" (#583)

# v2.4.0 - 2025-03-06

## Improvements:

* Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ReqnrollPlugin: Improved message when [ScenarioDependencies] can't be found or has an incorrect return type (#494)
* Include original exception for binding errors (`BindingException`) (#513)

## Bug fixes:

* Fix: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ReqnrollPlugin, the plugin was only searching for [ScenarioDependencies] in assemblies with step definitions (#477)
* Fix: xUnit Conservative Mode is not supported together with xUnit v2 (#473)
* Fix: Messages logged through `IReqnrollOutputHelper` are added to the output with a `->` prefix that should be reserved for output messages of Reqnroll itself (#504)
