Reqnroll (pronounced as [reknroʊl]) is an open-source Cucumber-style BDD test automation framework for .NET. It has been created as a reboot of the SpecFlow project.

Reqnroll enables writing executable specifications for BDD using Gherkin, the widely-accepted *feature file* specification format. With that you can define the requirements using *Given-When-Then* style *scenarios* and turn them to automated tests in order to verify their implementation.
