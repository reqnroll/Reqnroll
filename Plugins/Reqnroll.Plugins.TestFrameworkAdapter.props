  REQNROLL TEST FRAMEWORK ADAPTER SDK
  
  This file defines properties and extensions to MSBuild which ensure a runtime and generator plugin can be built and
  and packed correctly.
  
  Runtime plugins are loaded into Reqnroll at runtime, where generator plugins are loaded into the MSBuild process and picked
  up by the Reqnroll generator. To deliver a test framework adapter, both kinds of plugin are packed as separate assemblies.
  The SDK expects the runtime plugin to be a project that also references a generator plugin project. The runtime plugin 
  project imports this SDK to create the publishable NuGet package and the generator plugin project is packed into the /build 
  folder of the NuGet package.
  
  NuGet package layout:
  /assets
    /icon.png <- The package icon
  /build      <- Contains a copy of all files from the project's /build folder plus SDK-defined files
    /<tfm>    <- Contains the generator plugin assembly compiled for that Target Framework
    /Reqnroll.TestFrameworkAdapter.props   <- Prop file added by the SDK
    /Reqnroll.TestFrameworkAdapter.targets <- Targets file added by the SDK
  /lib
    /<tfm>    <- Contains the runtime plugin assembly compiled for that Target Framework
