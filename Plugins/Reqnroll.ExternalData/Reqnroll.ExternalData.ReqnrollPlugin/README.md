Reqnroll.ExternalData provides external data loading capabilities for Reqnroll scenarios.

The Reqnroll ExternalData plugin lets teams separate test data from test scenarios, and reuse examples across a large set of scenarios. This is particularly helpful when a common set of examples needs to be consistently verified in different scenarios.

Supported Data Sources: CSV, JSON, and excel files
