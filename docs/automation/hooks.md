# Hooks

Hooks (event bindings) can be used to perform additional automation logic at specific times, such as any setup required prior to executing a scenario. In order to use hooks, you need to add the `Binding` attribute to your class. Hooks can be synchronous or asynchronous, allowing them to perform operations that can benefit from async programming patterns:

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario]
    public void SetupTestUsers()
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario]
    public async Task SetupTestUsersAsync()
    {
        // Asynchronous setup logic
        // Example async operation
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

Hooks are global, but can be restricted to run only for features or scenarios by defining a [scoped binding](scoped-bindings), which can be filtered with [tags](scoped-bindings.md#different-steps-for-different-tags). The execution order of hooks for the same type is undefined, unless [specified explicitly](#hook-execution-order).

The `[BeforeScenario]` in the following example will execute only for those scenarios that are (implicitly or explicitly) tagged with `@requiresUsers`.

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario("@requiresUsers")]
    public void SetupTestUsers()
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario("@requiresUsers")]
    public async Task SetupTestUsersAsync()
    {
        //...
        // Asynchronous setup logic
        // Example async operation
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```


## Supported Hook Attributes

| Attribute | Tag filtering* | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `[BeforeTestRun]`<br/>`[AfterTestRun]` | not possible | Automation logic that has to run before/after the entire test run (see note below). The method it is applied to must be static. |
| `[BeforeFeature]`<br/>`[AfterFeature]` | possible | Automation logic that has to run before/after executing each feature<br/> The method it is applied to must be static. |
| `[BeforeScenario]` or `[Before]`<br/>`[AfterScenario]` or `[After]` | possible | Automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario or scenario outline example |
| `[BeforeScenarioBlock]`<br/>`[AfterScenarioBlock]` | possible | Automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario block (e.g. between the "givens" and the "whens") |
| `[BeforeStep]`<br/>`[AfterStep]` | possible | Automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario step |

```{note}
As most of the unit test runners do not provide a hook for executing logic once the tests have been executed, the `[AfterTestRun]` event is triggered by the test assembly unload event. 

The exact timing and  thread of this execution may therefore differ for each test runner.

```

You can annotate a single method with multiple attributes, and both synchronous and asynchronous methods can be used as hooks, depending on the needs of your test setup and teardown logic.

## Using Hooks with Constructor Injection

You can use [context injection](context-injection) to access scenario level dependencies in your hook class using constructor injection.
For example you can get the `ScenarioContext` injected in the constructor:

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    private ScenarioContext _scenarioContext;

    public MyHooks(ScenarioContext scenarioContext)
    {
        _scenarioContext = scenarioContext;
    }

    [BeforeScenario]
    public void SetupTestUsers()
    {
        //_scenarioContext...
    }
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    private ScenarioContext _scenarioContext;

    public MyHooks(ScenarioContext scenarioContext)
    {
        _scenarioContext = scenarioContext;
    }

    [BeforeScenario]
    public async Task SetupTestUsersAsync()
    {
        //_scenarioContext...
        // Example async operation
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

```{note}
For static hook methods you can use parameter injection which can be combined with asynchronous execution to resolve dependencies and perform setup or teardown tasks asynchronously.
```

## Using Hooks with Parameter Injection

You can add parameters to your hook method that will be automatically injected by Reqnroll.
For example you can get the `ScenarioContext` injected as parameter in the BeforeScenario hook.

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario]
    public void SetupTestUsers(ScenarioContext scenarioContext)
    {
        //scenarioContext...
    }
}
```


```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[Binding]
public class MyHooks
{
    [BeforeScenario]
    public async Task SetupTestUsersAsync(ScenarioContext scenarioContext)
    {
        //scenarioContext...
        // Example async operation
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

Parameter injection is especially useful for hooks that must be implemented as static methods.

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[Binding]
public class Hooks
{
    [BeforeFeature]
    public static void SetupStuffForFeatures(FeatureContext featureContext)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting " + featureContext.FeatureInfo.Title);
    }
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[Binding]
public class Hooks
{
    [BeforeFeature]
    public static async Task SetupStuffForFeaturesAsync(FeatureContext featureContext)
    {
        // Example async operation
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        Console.WriteLine("Starting " + featureContext.FeatureInfo.Title);
    }
}
```

In the BeforeTestRun hook you can resolve test thread specific or global services/dependencies as parameters.

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[BeforeTestRun]
public static void BeforeTestRunInjection(ITestRunnerManager testRunnerManager)
{
    //All parameters are resolved from the test run (global) container automatically.
    var location = testRunnerManager.TestAssembly.Location;
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[BeforeTestRun]
public static async Task BeforeTestRunInjectionAsync(ITestRunnerManager testRunnerManager)
{
    var location = testRunnerManager.TestAssembly.Location;

    // Example async operation
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}
```

Depending on the type of the hook the parameters are resolved from a container with the corresponding lifecycle.

| Attribute | Container |
|-----------|-----------|
| `[BeforeTestRun]`<br/>`[AfterTestRun]` | TestRunContainer ("global" container) |
| `[BeforeFeature]`<br/>`[AfterFeature]` | FeatureContainer    |
| `[BeforeScenario]`<br/>`[AfterScenario]`<br/>`[BeforeScenarioBlock]`<br/>`[AfterScenarioBlock]`<br/>`[BeforeStep]`<br/>`[AfterStep]`| ScenarioContainer |

{#hook-execution-order}
## Hook Execution Order

By default the hooks of the same type (e.g. two `[BeforeScenario]` hook) are executed in an unpredictable order. If you need to ensure a specific execution order, you can specify the `Order` property in the hook's attributes.

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File
[BeforeScenario(Order = 0)]
public void CleanDatabase()
{
    // we need to run this first...
}

[BeforeScenario(Order = 100)]
public void LoginUser()
{
    // ...so we can log in to a clean database
}
```

```{code-block} csharp
:caption: Hook File with async method
[BeforeScenario(Order = 0)]
public async Task CleanDatabaseAsync()
{
    // we need to run this first...
    // Example async operation
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}

[BeforeScenario(Order = 100)]
public async Task LoginUserAsync()
{
    // ...so we can log in to a clean database
    // Example async operation
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}
```

The number indicates the order, not the priority, i.e. the hook with the lowest number is always executed first.

If no order is specified, the default value is 10000. However, we do not recommend on relying on the value to order your tests and recommend specifying the order explicitly for each hook.

```{note}
If a hook throws an unhandled exception, subsequent hooks of the same type are not executed. If you want to ensure that all hooks of the same types are executed, you need to handle your exceptions manually.
```
```{note}
If a `BeforeScenario` throws an unhandled exception then all the scenario steps will be marked as skipped and the `ScenarioContext.ScenarioExecutionStatus` will be set to `TestError`.
```

## Tag Scoping

Most hooks support tag scoping. Use tag scoping to restrict hooks to only those features or scenarios that have *at least one* of the tags in the tag filter (tags are combined with OR). You can specify the tag in the attribute or using [scoped bindings](scoped-bindings).
