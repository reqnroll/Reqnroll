# RR1021: Step methods should not return values

## Cause
A method is decorated with one of the Reqnroll step binding attributes and returns a value other than `System.Task` or `System.ValueTask`.

## Description
When a synchronous step method is invoked by Reqnroll, it is not expected to return information to the Reqnroll runtime.

In the following example, the method returns a string:

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public string WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
    return "Game Start";
}
```

Reqnroll will invoke the step, however the return value is discarded.

In the case of asynchronous methods, a `System.Task` or `System.ValueTask` should be returned to represent the asynchronous operation. The runtime will observe the value and wait for the operation to complete before continuing execution.

Additional `System.Task<TResult>` or `System.ValueTask<TResult>` can be returned by a step:

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game ")]
public async Task<string> WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);

    return "Game Start";
}
```

Like with synchronous methods, Reqnroll will invoke the step and discard the result.

## How to fix
For synchronous methods, change the method signature to a `void` return and remove any values returned by the method:

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public void WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
}
```

For asynchronous methods, change the method signature to `System.Task` or `System.ValueTask` as appropriate and modify any return statements to omit values, or remove the return statement entirely.

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public async Task WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}
```
