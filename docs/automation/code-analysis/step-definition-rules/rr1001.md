# RR1001: Step text cannot be null

## Cause
A method is decorated with one of the Reqnroll step binding attributes and has specified a string to bind to, but the argument is _null_ (_Nothing_ in Visual Basic).

## Description
When a method is decorated with a step attribute, the Reqnroll system adds it to the list of available step definitions. When binding steps in examples to step definitions, the text specified in the binding attribute is used to match the step text. If the attribute specifies the text value as _null_ (_Nothing_ in Visual Basic), it will cause it to bind to no steps, such as in the following example:

```CSharp
[When(null)]
public void WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
}
```

## How to fix
Either add some text to the declared attribute, or remove the text argument entirely. The following example shows possible solutions for correctly declaring step methods.

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public void WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
}

[Then] // Uses method-name based matching to match "Then the game starts"
public void ThenTheGameStarts()
{
}
```
