# RR1022: Asynchronous step methods must return a Task, Task&lt;TResult&gt;, ValueTask or ValueTask&lt;TResult&gt;

## Cause
A method is decorated with one of the Reqnroll step binding attributes, is marked with the `async` keyword, and has a return type other than `System.Task`, `System.Task<TResult>`, `System.ValueTask` or `System.ValueTask<TResult>`.

## Description
Reqnroll intends step methods to be invoked sequentially: steps are invoked in the order in which they are written in a feature. In the case of asynchronous methods, Reqnroll waits for the asynchronous operation to complete before continuing.

However, it is possible to write asynchronous methods which do not return an awaitable value:

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public async void WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}
```

This style of asynchronous method will cause execution of the step to be started by Reqnroll, however control returns immediately and execution will continue. This can lead to step execution overlapping and unexpected race conditions.

## How to fix
Change the method return type to `System.Task` or `System.ValueTask` as appropriate:

```CSharp
[When("maker starts a game")]
public async Task WhenMakerStartsAGame()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}
```
