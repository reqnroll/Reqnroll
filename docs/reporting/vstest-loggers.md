# .NET test execution framework loggers

The tests generated by Reqnroll from the BDD scenarios integrate into the .NET test execution model, and therefore the generic loggers provided for .NET can also be used with Reqnroll.

The following example uses the TRX logger to produce a TRX test result file as the result of the execution.

```{code-block} pwsh
:caption: Terminal
> dotnet test --logger trx
[...]
Results File: C:\MySolution\MyReqnrollProject\TestResults\gaspar_WORK_2025-07-29_15_38_19.trx
[...]
```

The loggers can have additional parameters. For example, for the TRX logger you can specify the output file name. For further details please see the `--logger` option of the [`dotnet test` command documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test?tabs=dotnet-test-with-vstest).


```{code-block} pwsh
:caption: Terminal
> dotnet test --logger "trx;logfilename=result.trx"
[...]
Results File: C:\MySolution\MyReqnrollProject\TestResults\result.trx
[...]
```

A few common logger use cases can be found in the following table. The complete list of the available loggers can be found in the [VSTest documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/blob/main/docs/report.md#available-test-loggers).
