# Integrations to external reporting solutions

Other external or custom reporting solutions can also be used with Reqnroll. The following list contains a few options that can be considered.

```{note}
In addition to the listed options below, you can also check the [](plugin-list-filter-formatter) page for other publicly available formatter plugins that can be used to generate reports in different formats.
```

*   [Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/), one of the most popular open-source reporting tool with an integration with Reqnroll, so you can use Allure as a reporting tool with Reqnroll. See the [Allure Report Reqnroll integration documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/reqnroll/) for details.
*   [Expressium LivingDoc](https://github.com/ExpressiumOSS/Expressium.LivingDoc), an open-source tool that generates a single HTML test report in a Living Documentation style for ReqnRoll projects.
*   Johan Van Berkel (ICT Improve) posted about an enterprise reporting solution they have built from open-source components that you can also consider. See details in his [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/takes-village-johan-van-berkel-bofre/).
