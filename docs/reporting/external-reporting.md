```{note}
In addition to the listed options below, you can also check the [](plugin-list-filter-formatter) page for other publicly available formatter plugins that can be used to generate reports in different formats.
```

*   [Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/), one of the most popular open-source reporting tool with an integration with Reqnroll, so you can use Allure as a reporting tool with Reqnroll. See the [Allure Report Reqnroll integration documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/reqnroll/) for details.
