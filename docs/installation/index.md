# Installation & Setup

Reqnroll is distributed as a set of NuGet packages that you need to configure for your project, for most of the cases there is no additional configuration required. It is also recommended to configure your Integrated Development Environment (IDE, e.g. Visual Studio 2022) to work conveniently with Reqnroll.
